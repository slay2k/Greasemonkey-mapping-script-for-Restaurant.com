Restaurant.com Mapper
=====================

A trivial effort to simplify Restaurant.com dining selection. Fetches addresses asynchronously.

Installation
------------
1. Install Greasemonkey
2. Drag script into browser

Bugs
----
* Zoom level pretty arbitrary
* Auto-centering only works if restaurants are in the same vicinity (an outlier will throw GMaps off)

Nice to have
------------
Dynamic map. Restaurant hours and certificate details inside infowindows ?
